# House Price Prediction Project Report

## Introduction
This report details the development of a machine learning solution for house price prediction, from data preprocessing to model deployment. The project follows best practices in machine learning and software engineering to create a robust, production-ready solution.

## 1. Data Preprocessing

### Dataset Selection
For this project, I chose the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn. This dataset contains 20,640 instances with 8 numeric attributes:
- MedInc: Median income in the block group
- HouseAge: Median house age in the block group
- AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
- AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
- Population: Block group population
- AveOccup: Average number of household members
- Latitude: Block group latitude
- Longitude: Block group longitude

The target variable is the median house value, which is given in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed EDA to understand the dataset characteristics:
- The dataset contains no missing values
- The distribution of house prices is right-skewed
- There is moderate correlation between features like MedInc and house prices

Key visualizations included:
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features
- Distribution plot of the target variable
- Pairplots to identify feature interactions

### Data Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing pipeline included:
1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Although the dataset didn't have missing values, I implemented methods to handle them (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as:
   - RoomsPerHousehold: Average rooms divided by household size
   - PopulationDensity: Population divided by average occupancy
3. **Feature Scaling**: Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features, ensuring models won't be biased by different scales
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets with stratification to maintain the same distribution

All preprocessing steps were encapsulated in a reusable `DataPreprocessor` class that can be applied to new data during inference.

## 2. Model Training & Evaluation

### Model Selection
I trained and compared four regression models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost

Initial evaluation showed that ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) performed significantly better than simpler models.

## 3. Model Deployment

### API Development
I developed a REST API using Flask to serve predictions with the following endpoints:
- `/predict`: Accepts house features as JSON and returns the predicted price
- `/health`: Health check endpoint for monitoring

### Error Handling and Logging
The API includes:
- Comprehensive logging of requests and predictions
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Default values for missing features

### Containerization
I containerized the application using Docker to enable easy deployment across different environments. The container:
- Uses Python 3.9 slim as the base image
- Installs only necessary dependencies
- Exposes port 5000 for the API

### Testing
The API was tested using:
- Unit tests for the prediction logic
- Integration tests for the entire API flow
- Manual tests using curl and Postman

## 4. MLOps Considerations

### Model Versioning
All models were serialized using joblib with clear version naming, ensuring reproducibility and easy rollback if needed.

### Monitoring
The API includes:
- Performance logging
- Health check endpoint
- Input validation

### Scalability
The solution is designed to be scalable:
- Containerized for easy horizontal scaling
- Stateless API design 
- Minimal dependencies

## 5. Conclusion and Future Improvements

The implemented solution successfully predicts house prices with good accuracy (RÂ² = 0.8512). The XGBoost model provides a good balance between prediction accuracy and inference speed.

Future improvements could include:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate more location-based features using external data
2. **Model Ensemble**: Combine multiple models for better performance
3. **Online Learning**: Implement a system to retrain the model as new data becomes available
4. **A/B Testing**: Set up infrastructure for comparing different models in production
5. **Front-end Interface**: Develop a simple web UI for end users

## 6. Technical Challenges and Solutions

During development, I faced several challenges:
1. **Feature Scaling**: Needed to ensure the same scaler was used for training and inference
   - Solution: Saved the scaler object with joblib and applied it consistently
   
2. **API Robustness**: Had to handle various edge cases in input data
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive validation and default values

3. **Model Size**: The optimal XGBoost model was relatively large
   - Solution: Pruned less important features and optimized hyperparameters

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to production deployment, following best practices in software engineering and machine learning operations.
